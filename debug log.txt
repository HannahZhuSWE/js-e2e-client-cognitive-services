-tried to check file that contains images to see if there are any issues
-tried to print analysis variable to see why the field is undefined
-found that it was because the tags parameter that was passed into includesText is undefined
-used console.log to print analysis (because the tags that's passed in is analysis.tags)
-did not see a tags field in analysis 
-can't tell if computervision successfully returned anything, could be the reason there's no tags field
-looked at computer vision API and noticed it doesn't match analysis (value assigned to the return value)
-checked image link passed in and there doesn't seem to be any issues

 said that either a json or an error code and message should return however I don't see an error code but the json doesn't look valid either
